### Hi, I am Guilherme Assuncao. A computer science student at USF!! ðŸ‘‹
### ABOUT ME
### I am currently a Computer Science major at The University of South Florida. I have always liked to solve problems that require logical and critical thinking. Therefore, I believe that in Computer Science I will continue to be tested on my problem solving skills and further develop it. As I have learned along my academic career, there is always a better way to achieve the same results.
