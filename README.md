### Hi, I am Guilherme Assuncao. A computer science student at USF!! ðŸ‘‹
### --------------------------------------------------- ABOUT ME ----------------------------------------------------
### I am currently a Computer Science major at The University of South Florida. I have always liked to solve problems that require logical and critical thinking. Therefore, I believe that in Computer Science I will continue to be tested on my problem solving skills and further develop it. As I have learned along my academic career, there is always a clever way to achieve the same results.

### As a Computer Science student, I was tasked to work in many assignments with varying difficult level. One of my achievements was being able to construct a fully functional Coffee Robot that used IR sensors to follow a pre-assigned path. It was also as a Computer Science student that I used Phyton to code a Hare and Tortoise race simulation using the Turtle Module.

### I am seeking an entry-level internship role, where I will be able to continuously improve my skills and be a part of a team of likeminded people.
